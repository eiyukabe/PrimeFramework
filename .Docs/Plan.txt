	- Level script actor (For merging activator script system with behavior system)
- Behaviors
	- Generic spawner using behavior logic
	- Convert script execs to behaviors
	- Durations (and/or events?) like "when_activated" (or whatever) default to behave like sequential_behaviors at the root
	- Add behavior events for built in Godot callbacks _OnReady and _OnEnterTree
	- (Request) Put behavior "managers" like "sequential_behavior" and "decorated_behavior" in their own folder
	   or give them a special suffix, or otherwise make them easy to find among regular behaviors so it's easy
	   to browse what the "manager" options are without having to remember it
